## Security Measures

### Data Protection

#### Encryption at Rest
- **Database**: AES-256 encryption for sensitive fields
- **File Storage**: Encrypted file systems
- **Backups**: Encrypted with separate keys

```python
# Example: Encrypting patient data
encrypted_notes = security_manager.encrypt_data(clinical_notes)
```

#### Encryption in Transit
- **TLS 1.3**: All API communications
- **Certificate Pinning**: For mobile/desktop clients
- **VPN**: Required for administrative access

#### Data Masking
- **PII/PHI**: Automatic masking in logs
- **Development**: Synthetic data only
- **Analytics**: De-identified datasets

### Authentication & Authorization

#### Multi-Factor Authentication
- Required for all administrative accounts
- Optional for researchers
- Enforced for API access

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
```python
# Roles and Permissions
ROLES = {
    "admin": ["all"],
    "researcher": ["read:patients", "read:analytics", "write:reports"],
    "analyst": ["read:analytics", "write:reports"],
    "viewer": ["read:reports"]
}
```

#### Session Management
- **Timeout**: 30 minutes of inactivity
- **Concurrent Sessions**: Limited to 3
- **Token Rotation**: Every 24 hours

### Audit Logging

All security-relevant events are logged:

```python
# Audit log structure
{
    "timestamp": "2025-01-20T10:30:00Z",
    "user_id": "researcher_123",
    "action": "patient_data_access",
    "resource": "patient_cohort",
    "ip_address": "192.168.1.100",
    "user_agent": "HealthcareAPI/1.0",
    "result": "success",
    "details": {
        "query_params": {...},
        "records_accessed": 150
    }
}
```

### Input Validation

#### SQL Injection Prevention
```python
# Safe parameterized query
query = """
    SELECT * FROM patients 
    WHERE diagnosis_code = %s 
    AND encounter_date >= %s
"""
cursor.execute(query, (diagnosis_code, start_date))
```

#### API Input Validation
```python
class PatientSearchRequest(BaseModel):
    age_min: int = Field(..., ge=0, le=120)
    age_max: int = Field(..., ge=0, le=120)
    diagnosis: str = Field(..., regex="^[A-Z][0-9]{2}\.?[0-9]{0,2}$")
```
