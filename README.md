# Healthcare-Research-Data-Pipeline-Project
Essentially combining my skills in Healthcare, with my skills in tech to create something not only cool, but perhaps even useful.
So here, I have basically created a comprehensive Research Data Engineer project that demonstrates all the skills that I have in Data Engineering, and Cybersecurity while adding the Healthcare factor, while still incorporating cybersecurity best practices. This is a Healthcare Research Data Pipeline system that showcases my expertise to its fullest extent.
